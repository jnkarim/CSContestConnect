# CSContestConnect  

**CSContestConnect** is a full-stack web application built with **.NET** and **PostgreSQL** for managing computer science hackathons and programming contests.  
It provides a structured platform where different roles such as **admins**, **moderators**, and **users** can interact seamlessly.  

- **Admins**: Create and manage contests, oversee user activities, and handle system-wide settings.  
- **Moderators**: Support contest management by reviewing submissions, monitoring discussions, and ensuring fair play.  
- **Users (Participants)**: Register for contests, submit solutions, track scores, and engage with the community.  

### Key Features  
- **Contest Management**: Create, edit, and schedule programming contests with flexible settings.  
- **User Roles & Permissions**: Secure authentication and authorization system with role-based access.  
- **Submissions & Judging**: Participants can submit solutions which are automatically evaluated.  
- **Leaderboard & Results**: Real-time score tracking and ranking system for transparency.  
- **Scalability**: Designed with PostgreSQL and .NET to handle large numbers of users and submissions.  

This project aims to simplify the process of hosting and managing programming competitions, offering a smooth experience for both organizers and participants.
